# UC Berkeley - CS61b

This is the coursework from CS61b:Data Structures at UC berkeley.
It includes fundamental algorithms and data structures:

* Construction, modification, and traversal of linked list structures of various forms -- singly-linked, doubly-linked, and circular, with and without sentinels.
* Construction, modification, and traversal of binary trees (in particular, binary search trees and expression trees).
* Sorting of sequences by selection, insertion, quicksort, merge sort; binary search through a binary search tree of a sorted sequence.
* Binary heaps.
* Hashing.
* Elementary graph structures and algorithms.
